# Evaluating Shortest Path Solutions

## 📋 Description
Analyzed and compared various shortest path algorithms such as **Dijkstra’s**, **Breadth First Search (BFS)**, and **Depth First Search (DFS)** for performance and efficiency.  
- Evaluated algorithmic complexity and accuracy across different graph structures and datasets.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Implementation of **Dijkstra's**, **BFS**, and **DFS** algorithms  
- 🕒 Time measurement using `high_resolution_clock` for performance comparison  
- 🔄 Path reconstruction from source to all nodes  
- 📊 Tabular output showing `Node | Distance | Path`  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++  
- STL (Standard Template Library)  
- `<vector>`, `<queue>`, `<chrono>`, `<iomanip>`

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C++ and graph algorithms  
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks)  
- Any terminal or IDE to compile and run C++ code
